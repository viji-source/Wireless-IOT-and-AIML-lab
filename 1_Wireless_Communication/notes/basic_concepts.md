# Basic Wireless Communication Concepts

## What is Wireless Communication?
Wireless communication is the transmission of information over a distance without physical wires, using electromagnetic waves.

## Basic Block Diagram
Information Source → Transmitter → Channel → Receiver → Destination

## Common Wireless Channels
- AWGN Channel
- Rayleigh Fading Channel
- Rician Fading Channel

## Performance Metrics
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Bit Error Rate (BER)
- Bandwidth
- Data Rate

## Why Wireless is Important for IoT and AI/ML
- IoT devices communicate wirelessly
- Wireless signals generate large datasets
- AI/ML can be used for channel estimation, prediction, and optimization
